# Flight Price Prediction

The project aims to predict the dynamic fare of domestic flights based on certain factors like Airlines, Source, Destination, Duration, Number of Stops etc.

The lack of information available to buyers about future price movements makes it challenging to determine the best timing for airline ticket purchasing. This project aims to uncover underlying trends of flight prices in India using historical data, and suggest the best time to buy a flight ticket.

I have trained and built a Supervised Machine Learning model using different Regression algorithms for the prediction. The most accurate was **Random Forest Regressor** which was later used to develop and deploy a Web Application using Python Flask.

**Steps followed:**

1.	Imported necessary python libraries.

2.	Performed Exploratory Data Analysis 

3.	Data Visualization using seaborn and matplotlib

4.	Data Preprocessing to make the data more accurate and reliable.

5.	Built 5 different Regression Models with Random Forest Regressor,
Linear Regression, Support Vector Regressor, AdaBoost Regressor and
Gradient Boosting Regressor.

6.	Random Forest Regressor showed highest R2 score and again to improve the model, done Hyperparameter tuning on it.

7.	Developed and deployed a Web Application using Python Flask to predict the Ticket Price.

# Web App

This is how the final web page looks like.
